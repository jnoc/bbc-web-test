https://jono.page/assets/BBC
## Task
The site should load and display one article at a time, and provide a way for the user to move to
the next article. We have provided you with JSON data for 5 articles, you must present at least 3
of these articles. The dataset is here: https://github.com/bbc/news-coding-test-dataset
When the user gets to the end of the process, they should be presented with a way to submit a
ranking of the articles that they read. It does not matter how they are ranked.
## Requirements
* Use of modern JS throughout.
* Use of Git throughout. The solution must be hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, or similar, and
be sent to us with a link that is accessible to us
* Aside from library code, all code should be created by you and not taken from other
projects
* There should be the following HTTP requests (could be stubbed, see guidance):
    * 3-5 GET requests for the article data
    * 1 POST request submitting the ranking
* Semantic HTML
* A basic level of styling
* Handling of errors, such as network unavailability or slow connection
  * Provide a way of inducing such errors if you stub the server
* An attempt at ranking
